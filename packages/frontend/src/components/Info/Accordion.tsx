            Feeling a bit of déjà vu? That’s because we liked what Devcon did with their crypto auction and raffle so
            much that we decided to fork it for EthCC[6]. A massive "thank you" to the Devcon team for their support!
            <br />
            <br />
            So what does this mean for you? In an effort to make our ticket distribution more efficient and fair, we are
            selling a <Italic>portion</Italic> of this year’s tickets via an on-chain Auction & Raffle. Typically we
            sell tickets in waves; attendees need to wait for a specific release time and refresh the ticket shop
            rapidly in order to <Italic>hope</Italic> to claim & checkout with a ticket. Not to mention the need for a
            speedy internet connection and crossing your fingers that you’re close enough to our ticketing servers to be
            one of the first to secure a ticket.
            <br />
            <br />
            This year, we want to try something different, so we are experimenting with an on-chain Auction & Raffle to
            sell a <Italic>portion</Italic> of EthCC tickets.

            Join the contest by submitting a bid for the ticket based on the amount you would value having a EthCC
            ticket. Bid high to compete for the {auctionWinnersCount} tickets distributed in the auction, or be entered
            into the raffle for a chance to buy a ticket at the reserve price. You need to bid at least the reserve
            price, which is set to the price of a standard EthCC ticket at time of publication:{' '}
            <Bold>{reservePrice} ETH.</Bold> Please note there is a one-person-one-bid rule in place. You will need to
            submit your name at check-out, and we will check IDs at EthCC to verify that the participant is the ticket
            holder.

            {auctionWinnersCount}, you will be entered into a raffle and may be randomly chosen to win a EthCC ticket —
            if you were randomly selected in the Raffle & bid more than the reserve price, you can withdraw the
            difference. If you do not win, you can withdraw your entire bid, minus a 2% sybil-resistance fee.

            <strong>Using RANDAO to draw the raffle winners</strong>
            <span>
              What exactly is RANDAO? Simply put, it’s a decentralized mechanism for generating "reasonably random"
              numbers. Instead of trusting one person to come up with a random number on everyone’s behalf, RANDAO has a
              large group of people come together to generate a random number collectively.{' ('}

            We’re offering a loyalty discount to raffle winners who have attended previous editions of EthCC. Based on a
            snapshot we made for previous attendees, we have added a system in the contract which applies discounts for
            those wallets that collected previous EthCC Poaps.
